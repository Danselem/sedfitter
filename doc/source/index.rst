SED Fitting Tool documentation
==============================

There are two main ways to use the SED fitting utilities. The first is to
use it using command-line executables, which are use identically to the
fortran version of the SED fitting tool. This is provided to allow users to
upgrade to the python version without having to make major changes to
pipeline scripts. The second method is to use the routines from Python
directly. Both methods are described below.
