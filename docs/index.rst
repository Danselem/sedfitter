Python SED Fitter's documentation
=================================

This package is an experimental port of the SED Fitting tool described in
`Robitaille et al. (2007) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJS..169..328R>`_
and is still under active development. It should not be considered robust at
this stage.
